# DVM-BUDDY

The scope of this project was to create a user friendly experience for clients at their local veterinarian's office. Through this app, after a client creates an account, he/she can schedule appointments and find different service types for their pets such as walker and sitter. Through this classified section, a user can filter through the services by zipcode, distance and type of service. As an admin, he/she has access to view all the employee information, client information and upcoming appointments. In addition, the admin can create, update, and delete new reservation slots and classified cards. With this app, we hope to assist small veterinary clinics to improve their website and bring new clients in.
